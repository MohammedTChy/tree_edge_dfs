# tree_edge_dfs


The input to the code is a tree represented as a list of edges. The first line of the input is the number of nodes in the tree, and each subsequent line represents an edge between two nodes and the color of that edge.

The code uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the tree and calculate the number of leaf nodes. It uses an ArrayList to store the adjacency list representation of the tree.
